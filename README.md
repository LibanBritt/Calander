# Calander

I made a calander/scheduler and it was very tough 

I essentially enlisted in the help of other programmers and they helped me essentially make one huge function. They helped me make a for each loop using jqury that ran through my html and added the correct class depending on the time of day based on the API being used. 

I also had a local storage object created that would store the value being placed inside the textbox of the calander.
